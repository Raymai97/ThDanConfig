Touhou Danmaku Game Config Tips

1. Display

Touhou 6 to 10 support 640x480 resolution only.

Touhou 11 to 13 support 960x720 and 1280x960 in windowed mode only.
They're not really HD; they just simply scale to higher resolution.

Touhou 14 and later games has real HD textures, supporting HD resolution in fullscreen mode as well.

Any game prior to Touhou 10 doesn't support "Ask at startup" option.

2. Rendering rate

Always try 60FPS first, really. You will miss out the smooth experience of Touhou gaming if you don't do so.

If you can't get 60FPS and experience slowdown in game, then try to mess with Input Latency first.

If your PC is really too slow, then try 30FPS or 20FPS.
For me, 20FPS is unacceptable as the game control will be very sluggish, nightmare for danmaku dodging.

3. Input Latency

If you have frame-dropping or input response problem, changing this might help.
As for me, choosing 'Fast' has solved most of the frame-dropping problem.

'Stable' and 'Normal' give same response as previous Touhou games.
ZUN says these options cause lower CPU usage, and try 'Stable' if 'Normal' doesn't work well.
'Automatic' will try to provide the fastest response.
'Fast' will provide the fastest response but might cause graphic glitches.

ZUN says this option is only vaild for 60FPS rendering rate.

4. Color mode

Just choose 32-bit. Touhou games look worse than crap in 16-bit color mode.
Windows doesn't support 16-bit color video mode since Windows 8, too.

5. Joypad sensitivity

Not sensitive enough? Decrease this.
Too sensitive? Increase this.

I don't have a joypad anyway. /.\

6. Misc (Before Touhou 10)

Don't mess with this unless you have idea what it is.
